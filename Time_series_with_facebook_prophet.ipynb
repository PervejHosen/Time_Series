        "\n",
        "According to the [article](https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/) on Facebook Research, Prophet was initially developed for the purpose of creating high quality business forecasts. This library tries to address the following difficulties common to many business time series:\n",
        "- Seasonal effects caused by human behavior: weekly, monthly and yearly cycles, dips and peaks on public holidays.\n",
        "- Changes in trend due to new products and market events.\n",
        "- Outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors claim that, even with the default settings, in many cases, their library produces forecasts as accurate as those delivered by experienced analysts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, Prophet has a number of intuitive and easily interpretable customizations that allow gradually improving the quality of the forecasting model. What is especially important, these paramaters are quite comprehensible even for non-experts in time series analysis, which is a field of data science requiring certain skill and experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the way, the original article is called \"Forecasting at Scale\", but it is not about the scale in the \"usual\" sense, that is addressing computational and infrastructure problems of a large number of working programs. According to the authors, Prophet should scale well in the following 3 areas:\n",
        "- Accessibility to a wide audience of analysts, possibly without profound expertise in time series.\n",
        "- Applicability to a wide range of distinct forecasting problems.\n",
        "- Automated performance estimation of a large number of forecasts including flagging of potential problems for their subsequent inspection by the analyst."

        "\n",
        "The Prophet library implements two possible trend models for $g(t)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first one is called *Nonlinear, Saturating Growth*. It is represented in the form of the [logistic growth model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function):\n",
        "\n",
        "$$g(t) = \\frac{C}{1+e^{-k(t - m)}},$$\n",

        "* $C$ is the carrying capacity (that is the curve's maximum value).\n",
        "* $k$ is the growth rate (which represents \"the steepness\" of the curve).\n",
        "* $m$ is an offset parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "This logistic equation allows modelling non-linear growth with saturation, that is when the growth rate of a value decreases with its growth. One of the typical examples would be representing the growth of the audience of an application or a website.\n",
        "\n",
        "Actually, $C$ and $k$ are not necessarily constants and may vary over time. Prophet supports both automatic and manual tuning of their variability. The library can itself choose optimal points of trend changes by fitting the supplied historical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, Prophet allows analysts to manually set changepoints of the growth rate and capacity values at different points in time. For instance, analysts may have insights about dates of past releases that prominently influenced some key product indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second trend model is a simple *Piecewise Linear Model* with a constant rate of growth. It is best suited for problems without saturating growth."
